# AWS Lambda Visitor Count Updater

This repository contains the code for an AWS Lambda function designed to update a visitor count in a DynamoDB table. The Lambda function is accessed via a REST API, and access to the API is controlled using API keys.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to track and update visitor counts for a website or application using AWS services. The Lambda function increments the visitor count stored in a DynamoDB table every time it is invoked through the REST API. This code is part of a larger project (Cloud Resume Challenge)

## Key Components

- **Lambda Function**: The `lambda_function.py` file contains the code for the AWS Lambda function responsible for updating the visitor count.
- **DynamoDB Table**: The DynamoDB table named `VisitorCount` is used to store the visitor count data.
- **REST API**: An API Gateway REST API is set up to trigger the Lambda function and provide access to it via HTTP requests.
- **API Keys**: Access to the REST API is controlled using API keys generated in API Gateway.

## Usage

To update the visitor count, make a HTTP request to the URL generated by the API Gateway, providing the API key in the request headers. The Lambda function will increment the visitor count in the DynamoDB table and return the updated count.
